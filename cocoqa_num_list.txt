caption: COCO-QA Number Questions
3202,Couting regarding to an object with a specific color
4305,Even counts to four
6805,Six is very hard unless there is a training example about six donuts
7270,Four again
8112,Tricky question - four engines in total but the picture is only showing two on one side
9148,Counting food is good because of the clear boundary
32912,Multiple objects but asking about bottles
28078,Multiple objects need to focus on different parts
3757,Mostly CNN-LSTM outputs more ``three''s and CNN-BOW outputs more ``two''s
9489,Seems to have no reason to answer ``four''
170,Both CNN models agree on counting
3449,This is not easy to get firstly because ``five'' is fairly large number to count and secondly because cutting cakes really doesn't imply five persons
24263,Again five is not easy to count for both models
6,Usually signs show ``one way''
25552,Answer is revealed in the phrase ``each other''
25671,Answer is revealed in the word ``is''
24776,LSTM captures ``is'' whereas BOW doesn't
811,Easy one but only blind BOW gets it
33482,Again blind BOW tend to guess ``four'' when it has no clue and other models just don't get thecorrect answer
12255,This one is impossible to get
38217,Objects are overlapped probably the model just guesses four planes regardless
