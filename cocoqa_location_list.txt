42,Image features are useful
857,Image features are useful
805,Inclusion of object (not just room and scene)
9648,This one is hard to see it is in a car
15891,Easy one for CNN
25218,Inclusion of object
25397,Hard to infer
35349,The model knows that the elephant is inside the mirror
137,BOW relies too much on image features and LSTM combines image and text well
23418,Funny picture
38461,It makes sense for the blind model to guess ``mirror''
6428,Answer could be bathroom as well but interesting to see the blind models choosing ``mirror''
26714,Many location based questions are noisy in the sense that there exist many valid answers, could be the object or the scene
23637,Synonyms are also the noise of the dataset
6144,As in the color case again the BOW fails to understand the question and directly uses image feature
172,Some questions are fairly easy and can be answered without looking at the image
8887,Easy one
