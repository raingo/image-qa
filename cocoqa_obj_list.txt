caption:COCO-QA Object Questions
2,Image features are useful
85,Image features are useful
223,Occluded object are still focusable
1213,Blind model has no clue from the text alone
1549,Both models know plural form, good sentence model that remembers ``are''
2007,When there are two objects present the model attend to the correct one
4974,Reletively small object to focus on
5429,Does not look like a regular cake and the model has to infer from the candles
1965,The CNN-LSTM model knows the plural but CNN-BOW does not
1966,The CNN-BOW again messed up the counting (mostly of the questions with LSTM win over BOW is on singular/plural)
2950,LSTM learns to add plural form from the verb tense
14930,Many items present but the LSTM figures out the correct item
15178,From the text alone it is misleading that there might exist multiple motorcycles
19533,BOW is not a good blend of visual information with the question semantics
24952,BOW is not a good blend of visual information with the question semantics
29528,Tray is hard to get
30568,It is rare to see something stuck into something and here CNN-LSTM win over other 4 models shows a good combination of image and question semantics
36019,LSTM remembers the beginning part of the question although the entire question is very long
38613,The object is fairly small to focus on
3098,In many cases where CNN-BOW wins over CNN-LSTM is just some synonyms of answers
14124,CNN-LSTM fails on this one because it probably takes in too much textual information
14518,CNN-LSTM fails
15499,Synonyms again
37066,Both objects are present but the LSTM output similar to Blind ones which tells us that it takes more textual information
385,Yellow food doesn't have to be bananas
1681,Overfits to people holding phones
2608,Hard for a bear to hold cellphone
828,Very long truck looks like a train?
33,Image provides no extra information and blind LSTM really focuses on the text to get the right answer
7231,Interesting that the blind model knows the correct answer whereas the CNN model thinks they are suitcases
24432,Very hard to answer bananas but the blind model made it
